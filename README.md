Sentiment Analysis using NLP & Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques can be used to analyze textual data and classify sentiments as positive or negative. The project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data analysis, text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is a widely used NLP task that helps in understanding user opinions from text data such as reviews, comments, or feedback.In this project, we preprocess raw text data, extract features using TF-IDF, and train a Logistic Regression classifier to predict sentiment.

Objectives
1. Perform basic data analysis on text data
2. Apply NLP preprocessing techniques
3. Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
4. Train a Machine Learning model for sentiment classification
5. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
6. Visualize results for better understanding

Technologies & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas & NumPy – Data handling
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
5. NLTK – Text preprocessing
6. Scikit-learn – Machine learning models & evaluation.

Methodology
1. Data Loading: Load review text and sentiment labels.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand dataset structure, Visualize sentiment distribution.
3. Text Preprocessing:
a. Lowercasing
b. Removing special characters
c. Stopword removal
d. Stemming
4. Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorization
5. Model Training: Logistic Regression
6. Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

Results: 
A. The model successfully classifies text into positive and negative sentiments
B. Achieved good accuracy on test data
C. Visualized results using confusion matrix and plots
